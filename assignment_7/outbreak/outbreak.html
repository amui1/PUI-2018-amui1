      <p class = "descrip">Outbreak is part of CMU HCII's Sensing Curiosity in Play
        Responding (SCIPR) project. This project focuses on fostering scientific
        curiosity in middle school students through tabletop board games.
        Outbreak, in particular, aims to encourage question asking and comfortableness
        with short term failure in students ages 9 and up.</p>
      <p class = "descrip">I first worked as a researcher and playtest coordinator.
        I was primarily responsible for running user tests every weekend from
        January to March. This included greeting parents, taking care of
        participants for the day, and running through the study protocol from
        beginning to end. During the week, I was responsible for analyzing field
        notes with the rest of the Outbreak team.</p>

        the game board, encountering threat rooms. The scientists have access to a
        sensing robot and ask it questions in order to deduce what is inside.</p>

      <p class = "descrip">For data analysis, our team focused on identifying
        relationships between emotion and specific game events, such as winning a
        round, getting into a team disagreement, or contributing a thoughtful question.
        We collected emotion quantitatively through a QEM map and specific observations
        documented in round-by-round field notes. Quantitative field observations
        included number of questions asked, number of conflicts and agreements, or
        number of rounds lost. Qualitative field observations included type of
        expression or phrases said. Other information was collected through a pre-study
        questionnaire on curiosity and post-study questionnaire on demographics.</p>
