      <h2 class = "heading">Service Summary</h2>
      <p class = "descrip">Wilbur is a service that helps teens learn financial literacy
        through virtual credit scores and enhanced financial conversations with their parents.</p>
      <p class = "descrip">Through a mobile application, a teen (14-16) loans money from her parents
        to buy items. The teen can pay back her debt through virtual money earned through
        parent assigned tasks, such as chores or getting an A on an exam.
        The teen stores her earnings in a virtual piggy bank and at the end of the month,
        she will receive a bill from PNC and will pay back the debt she has owed her parents.</p>
      <p class = "descrip">Simulating the real world, Wilbur:</p>
      <ul id = "simulating">
        <li>Allows teens to loan money from the parent, who in real applications, represent the bank.</li>
        <li>Provides a credit score that is affected by many factors such as timeliness in paying bills,
          amount of debt carried over, or amount of debt owed.</li>
        <li>Suggests a 30% safety wall, which echoes the industry recommendation of spending 30% of one's credit allowance.</li>

        From financial literacy articles, we were able to gather valuable findings from
        various financial literacy articles. Some key findings were:</p>
      <!--bullets for what we learned during secondary research  -->
      <ul id = "secondary_research">
        <li>Financial education programs do exist, but its effectiveness is unknown because there is a  lack of research and documentation. </li>
        <li>Because there is a substantial difference among young adults, a one-size-fits-all model does not work.
          Programs should be targeted towards a specific audience and specific area of education. </li>
        <li>Financial programs on market today work heavily on practicing financial skills, instead of teaching.</li>

        <li>Teens at this age still heavily rely on their parents. Therefore, parental support would be included and easier to engage from both user sides.</li>
